# PHSX815_Project3

Experiment: I am going to apply the maximum likelihood for a given function which defines how two rats pass the same route.
Scientists implemented two GPSs in two rats' heads.

How to run: Python 3 will calculate and plot the data.

I am still working on it to provide more details about the experiment and find other parameters according to project 3.
