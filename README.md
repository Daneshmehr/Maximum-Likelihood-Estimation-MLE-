Poisson regression assumes the response variable Y has a Poisson distribution, and assumes the logarithm of its expected value can be modeled by a linear combination of unknown parameters. 
I am going to apply the maximum likelihood for a given function and then estimate its confidence interval.

Python 3 will calculate and plot the data.
