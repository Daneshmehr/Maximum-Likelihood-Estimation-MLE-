# PHSX815_Project3

Experiment: I suppose that you have in your hand a GPS that tells you where you are. However, you also are worried about this thing
being not accurate so you bought another GPS so you have two GPSs now. One of them was purchased in the United States so uses u.s. satellites. The other one was purchased in Europe so it uses European satellites. Therefore, they are independent
estimates of where you are. I want to set up the problem where is your location based on the readings that you have the data from those two GPSs

How to run: Python 3 will calculate and plot the data.

In this project, I describe the idea of maximum likelihood in so-called generative models. The idea is to describe the model in which my data is generated, rather than just fitting my data to some model, which means that I have to make some assumptions about the probabilistic nature of the data. Therefore, the concept of the maximum likelihood is a way of saying what is the most likely scenario for the data I have collected.
